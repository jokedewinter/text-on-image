	<h2>Studious and critical practice</h2>

	<p>My work explores the relationship between multiculturalism and midlife subcultures.</p>
	<p>With influences as diverse as Munch and John Cage, new synergies are generated from both constructed and discovered structures.</p>
	<p>Ever since I was a child I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the mind. What starts out as triumph soon becomes corrupted into a manifesto of greed, leaving only a sense of decadence and the unlikelihood of a new understanding.</p>
	<p>As spatial phenomena become reconfigured through studious and critical practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the limits of our world.</p>
